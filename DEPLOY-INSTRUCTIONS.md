**Before:**
- ❌ Files had placeholder name

- ❌ Confusion about which files

**Now:**
- ✅ Files already have YOUR name
- ✅ Year is 2025
- ✅ Nothing to edit
- ✅ Just upload and go!

---

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong:

**404 Error:**
- Wait 5 minutes (GitHub can be slow)
- Hard refresh: Cmd + Shift + R
- Check Settings → Pages is enabled

**Wrong Attribution:**
- Check you uploaded files from THIS package
- Check you didn't upload a parent folder

**Files in Wrong Place:**
- Make sure files are in ROOT, not in a subfolder
- When uploading, select files INSIDE the folder, not the folder itself

---

## 🎉 You're Done!

Once your site is live:
- Share the URL with students
- Add Adobe Express template links later
- Update content anytime by editing `js/data.js`
